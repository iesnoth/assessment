      <li>The film was funded almost exclusively by the director, Tarsem, who used the money from his failed wedding after being dumped.</li>
      <li>In order to keep the acting of 5-year-old Catinca (Alexandria) genuine, Tarsem had Roy's actor, Lee Pace, live as a real invalid for months. When it was revealed he could walk, Catinca still didn't understand, and thought her love for him had cured him.</li>
      <li>There is very little CGI in the film. All of the amazing vistas and visuals in the film are real, using cleaver camera techniques.</li>
